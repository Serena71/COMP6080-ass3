1. used a responsive UI design to make sure the website is presentable on different screen sizes
2. used color to differentiate buttons, red stands for more dangerous actions, such as 'delete'/'remove', whereas 'green' represent a positive action, such as 'submit'
3. used 'alt' text for images and videos, to improve the accessibility
4. used aria props to give clear lable on the element / build relations between separate elements.
5. when both confirm and reject buttons are displayed together, we keep the confirm on the left and reject on the right, which builds up a consistant pattern for users to avoid any unwanted action by mistakes
6. chosed nice and different colors to fill up the option buttons, provides better UI while also providing extra distinguishment on the option buttons
7. gave new quiz a default image to keep the dashboard neat and uniform
8. implemented progress bar while the page is still fetching data, this gives user some feedbacks so that they know the page is working as expected
9. implemented a colour-changing countdown bar for players, the bar change color from green to red when no bonus mark will be given, gives a clear indication to the players
10. disabled quiz from starting when no question is available, this avoids creating unnecessary empty session
